    What is Numerithms about? ðŸ¤”
</h3>  

<div>
    <P class="w-50 mx-auto">
        As a Computer Science student, we were required to study various algorithms, and mathematical procedures.
        Many of them are <span class="font-weight-bold">Numerical methods</span>, while some other are <span class="font-weight-bold">algorithms</span>.
        That was why I decided to build this. I wanted to implement these algorithms using Vanilla JavaScript only.
        <br />

        How did I coin the word, <span class="font-italic">Numerithms?</span>
        <br />
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Numerical methods</span> + <span class="font-weight-bold">Algorithms</span> = Numerithms

        <br /><br />
        I hope you enjoy using it. ðŸ˜€
